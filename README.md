# Analysis of Jeopardy! questions

[Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!) is a famous American TV show where participants answer general knowledge questions. In this project, I've wrangled a dataset with questions and answers from several Jeopardy! shows, and tried to find a pattern that could give us clues to answering questions better.
